Assign an object to the variable playlist and initialize the object with
a key-value pair â€” the keys will be artist names and the values will be song titles.
(What limitation does this impose on our playlist?)


Create a function updatePlaylist that accepts three parameters: the playlist (an object),
 an artist name (a string), and a song title. The body of the function should add the song
 and artist as a key-value pair to the playlist object. The function should return the whole
 playlist.

Create a function removeFromPlaylist that accepts two arguments
(the playlist object and the artist name). The body of the function
should delete the key-value pair from the playlist and return the updated playlist.
